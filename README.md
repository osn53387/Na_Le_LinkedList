## Compiling
To run the program, you first have to compile program using the following commands:
```
make
```
or
```
make cl
```
## Execution
After compilation, you should create a .txt file with all the numbers that you want to put inside your linked list.
You can run the program using the following command:
```
java -cp bin csci2720.p1.LinkedListDriver <filename.txt>
```
## Testing Sample Files
We have created sample input files called `input.txt` and `input2.txt`. If you want to test out one of these input files,
you can run the following commands:
```
java -cp bin csci2720.p1.LinkedListDriver input.txt
```
or
```
java -cp bin csci2720.p1.LinkedListDriver input2.txt
```
## Clean Up Directory
Finally, you can clean up the directory after compiling and executing using the following command:
```
make clean
```
